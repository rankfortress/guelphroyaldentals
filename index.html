	At Guelph Royal Dental Centre, we are committed to providing comprehensive dental care for the entire family.We offer a wide range of services, including periodontal surgeries and treatment, as well as dental implants. Offering most procedures in house means patients can receive treatment as promptly as possible. By keeping our services under one roof, we are able cut down the time a patient waits for their treatment, making your experience in our clinic seamless. Our practice is fully digitized, making your visit to our office as efficient as possible. All patient files are digital and we utilize digital x-rays and ortho-panoramic radiographs. Additionally, during treatment our doctors utilize intraoral camera technology, allowing you to see exactly what they see in a diagnosis. We find this helps patients more fully understand their treatment options and steps they require.
	
	 patientâ€™s first visit to Guelph Royal Dental Centre entails a comprehensive dental exam and treatment planning with diagnostics and a full set of x-rays. In addition, we typically complete a full dental cleaning and periodontal assessment. Patients are recommended to start visiting a dentist at three years old, continuing with regular exams and cleanings twice a year, depending on their periodontal status. We also suggest patients in their teenage years (or older) to have an orthodontic consultation.
